check for empty JSON files


Send emails automatically


Ignore helper functions (honestly just hard-check that there are 12 tests, since there are a fixed number (4) of the non-helper functions.)


Record student EIDs, names, and group number in email message (for grading)


Check unit test results (all dots no F's)


Add progress tracker (since the script takes a WHILE to run)


Add comments to abnormal evaluations


Make acceptance tests individually available (like unit tests, instead of erroring out upon encountering one error) (although erroring out would have been the behavior of the student's code, so erroring out should be punished further)
